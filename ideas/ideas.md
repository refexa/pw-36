This is the file write down the ideas for **pyweek 36** for the following themes:

1. Quick quick slow
2. Monsieur Detective
3. Dark matter
4. Salmon run
5. So many diamonds

### Ideas

#### 1. Quick quick slow

- Hurry up, don't run - safety principle in situations of urgency
- "Hurry up and wait" - a cynical idiom, origin in military operations
- Maybe it is a French or Belgian saying? - ref. Monsieur Detective
- 'sick sick plow' *or* 'thick thick plow' *or* 'chick chick plow' <- sounds similar... not sure what it means

1. Monster hunt: monsters react to movement so be quick to get into position but very slow when it looks at you!

   Top down? Hide behind obstacles. Weapons and weak spot. Sneak up! Maybe use a goat as bait.
2. interpret it as morse code -> ..- means U ==> guitar hero style game where you have to jump from dot to dot and
   run on the lines, decode the message an get extra points if you enter it correctly at the end of the level

3. ninja run

#### 2. Monsieur Detective

- Detective Hercule Poirot comes to mind - Agatha Christie novels and movies
- Detective Clouseau - Pink Panther

- point and click style game?
- dialogs?
- Solve a robbing case? Movies 'All knifes out' come to mind.

1. Find the vanished detective investigating his room -> point&click style game with many puzzles

    - clock -> day/night window -> star constellation
    - light on/of -> shadow information
    - safe lock -> date
    - safe lock -> 1 digit entry for numbers 0-99
    - ...

#### 3. Dark matter

- Make-believe stuff that must be, in order to support a theory :)
- The 2015 TV series; many movies; books and shorts?
- An obscure or obfuscated thing or circumstance of importance
- An evil thing or circumstance of importance
- A moody or brooding aspect

1. spaceship adventure in space? Space Odyssey

2. The dark matter seems to swallow all... your mission: find out why and
   prevent that it swallows all (its like a fog). Jump/teleport from still
   visible 'islands' to move around.

3. Darkmatterpunk (like Steampunk or Cyberpunk, only with dark matter).

#### 4. Salmon run

- This is what the annual migration of salmon is called
- It implies a long and treacherous river journey, bears, fishermen, wilderness
- looks like there is an extension for the game SPLATTOON,
  shooting ink everywhere coloring the world

1. fishing simulator where you are a bear catching salmons (and the swimming goats) in the river (high score game?)

2. Avoid getting cooked
    - The salmon run is a dangerous time for the salmon. So of course, we should make people play the salmon.
    - I imagine swimming upstream from left to right in a scrolling river. Avoid the dangers. Yes, hurdles with long and
      high jumps, bears swiping at ya, fishermen trying to lure you on their hooks with fat, juicy worms, kids throwing
      stones in the water, an evil water turbine at the hydroelectric plant. (edited)
    - People swimming. Maybe you get daredevil points for messing with the dangers more than is necessary. Motorboats,
      Piranha, sharks, otters - we could get a little fancy with graphic assets.

3. Run for your life over the kitchen sink.
4. Swim up the river to mate
    - segment 1 - survive the rocky
    - segment 2 - Avoid the sushi chefs
    - segment 3 - diamond collection
    - segment 4 - avoid the sharks
    - segment 5 - more diamonds
    - segment 6 - avoid the foxes
    - segment 7 - avoid the rays
    - the end

#### 5. So many diamonds

- Makes me think of the global diamond fraud; most of the diamonds in the world are locked away in vaults in order to
  create the illusion of a scarce and valuable gem; diamonds are truly a very abundant form of carbon
- Useful in industrial and high tech
- not sure why, but lasers come to mind
- shiny objects

2. indiana jones/tomb raider like game to explore caves or maya temple ruins, snatch the diamonds with your
   wip/lasso and get out before the enraged spirits/ghost gets you...! And avoid the angry goats too.
3. point and click style/commandos like (real time) game where you have to rob the vault?
4. find/create all ingredients/tools to fabricate diamonds...
5. Mining Mafia (GTA5 style: GTD? Grand Theft Diamonds)
