### Pyweek 36 Theme: *Dark Matter*

### Game elements

#### Conditions

- win: get to the end of the level
- loose: run out of dark matter in the storage

#### Steering

- arrows or asdw to move around
- space to shoot
- other key to switch to other weapon(s)?

#### Entities

- Spaceship
   - steered by the player
- Walls, static
- Space (the space to fly around)
   - may have background, stars
- Droids
   - enemy, fly around, shoot bullets of lasers ?
- Blue klein bottles (bkb)
   - floats around, restore dark matter (add dark matter to storage) upon collision
- Red klein bottles (rkb)
   - floats around, removes dark matter from storage upon collision
- Gummbumms
   - move around, removes dark matter from storage upon collision
- Refexas
   - move around, ??
- Laser
- Bullet
- Shield
   - upon collision remove dark matter from storage
- Dark matter storage
   - stores the amount of dark matter
- Camera, moves and pushes the spaceship forward

#### Interactions

- spaceship - droid -> damage to dark matter
- spaceship - bkb -> restore dark matter
- spaceship - rkb -> damage to dark matter
- spaceship - refexa -> damage to dark matter
- spaceship - gumm -> damage to dark matter
- spaceship - laser -> damage to dark matter
- spaceship - bullet -> damage to dark matter
- spaceship - wall -> damage to dark matter
- spaceship - goat -> damage to dark matter
- droids - laser -> die
- droids - bullet -> die

### Ideas for *Dark matter*

- Make-believe stuff that must be, in order to support a theory :)
- The 2015 TV series; many movies; books and shorts?
- An obscure or obfuscated thing or circumstance of importance
- An evil thing or circumstance of importance
- A moody or brooding aspect

1. spaceship adventure in space? Space Odyssey

2. The dark matter seems to swallow all... your mission: find out why and
   prevent that it swallows all (its like a fog). Jump/teleport from still
   visible 'islands' to move around.

3. Darkmatterpunk (like Steampunk or Cyberpunk, only with dark matter).

### Blue Klein Bottle's concept

BlueKleinBottle — Today at 9:45 PM
Seg 1,5: drive safely, without hitting droids in the dark matter cloud 
Seg 2,4: Blue Klein Bottles
Seg 3,6: Red Klein Bottles
Seg 7: All 3 will be found along side plunderous aliens called refexas, which eat dark matter
End: If you have enough dark matter to make a scary cloud, the gummbumms will be scared away

DR0ID
to be clear our game is based on the arcade game vanguard as in this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MwVWsHBm5g right? So basically a horizontal scrolling space invaders like game?

BlueKleinBottle
kind of
Reminder: if you hit a droid you die, Blue Klein Bottles contain dark matter, red klein bottles and refexas remove dark matter

quick sketch: https://webwhiteboard.com/board/Yl3gGOM9dqVnk5k8TBflXtdU03znovr2/

MrGumm
I would make a modification

BlueKleinBottle
yes

MrGumm
At the end, you have to deal with all the baddy types on screen at the same time. But this is your last chance to get blue klein bottles and escape. The red ones still steal from you, and you can lose it all.

BlueKleinBottle
yess
thats what i thought
but 7 segments is enough
and this is in the 7th segment

MrGumm — Today at 9:49 PM
in fact
we could make all the levels harder by adding one baddy type; and keep the previous baddy types

BlueKleinBottle — Today at 9:49 PM
oooh
so level 1: droids with no bkbs
level 2: bkbs introduced but droids added
level 3: rkbs added
level 4: refexas
level 5: gummbumms
NEW
level 6: dark matter snake
level 7: antimatter jets
however, dark matter isnt related to teleportation @DR0ID

with a goat
space goats
grizzled space goats

DR0ID
so we have these elements: 
spaceship, droid, bkb, rkb, refexa, gumm, goat, laser, bullet, wall, star, Space, dark matter

and following interactions:
spaceship - droid -> damage to dark matter
spaceship - bkb -> restore dark matter
spaceship - rkb -> damage to dark matter
spaceship - refexa -> damage to dark matter
spaceship - gumm -> damage to dark matter
spaceship - laser -> damage to dark matter
spaceship - bullet -> damage to dark matter
spaceship - wall -> damage to dark matter
spaceship - goat -> damage to dark matter
droids - laser -> die
droids - bullet -> die

MrGumm
contact with:
bkbs give dark matter
rkbs steal dark matter
everything else steals dark matter
The whole point is to manage dark matter. I think weapon(s) should cost dark matter. and you have to save up a minimum amount to escape at the end.

DR0ID
what if you run out of dark matter? -> die?
so dark matter is sort of 'energy'?

MrGumm
yeah, that probably would make you go splat
dark matter converter 

DR0ID
dark matter drive
hmm, about damage, should be a health too or does it just cost some dark matter

MrGumm
let's say dark matter powers the shields. if they run out, one hit destroys the vessel. (edited)
so don't get hit, or you lose precious dark matter and eventually will be destroyed.

refexa
If bullets would be limited then, bkbs - restores bullet?

MrGumm
yes, bullets cost dark matter. so hitting a bkbs restores dark matter, and weapons
